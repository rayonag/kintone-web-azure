                The prophets of Israel knew that one day Gentile people would come to the land of Israel and help in its restoration. The prophet
                Isaiah mentions these Gentiles on several occasions. He refers to them as "servants" in Isaiah 56:6. They are called "servants and
                handmaids" in Isaiah 14:2. And in Isaiah 61:5, we read, "Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the foreigner
                shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers."
            </div>
            <div className="m-3">
                We can see from Scripture that Gentiles do not come to Israel in a high and mighty position, but rather in the position of a servant.
                Their position is much like that of Ruth of old. She was willing to abase herself to a position lower than that of a servant girl
                (Ruth 2:13). As a result, God highly exalted her to be the great-grandmother of King David.

            <div className="m-3 mb-8">
                There are great numbers of Christians from foreign lands in Israel today who have come here in meekness and humility to serve the
                Jewish people on behalf of God. In general, the work of volunteers is often the work that others do not wish to do. It is demanding
                and requires much patience and love. But in the end, it is also greatly rewarding.

                The history of Christian–Jewish relationships is seriously marred by the anti-Semitic behavior of Christians toward Jews. The

                Tragically, established Christian denominations and institutions participated, either actively or by turning a blind eye, in these
                atrocities. This has created an atmosphere of fear and distrust that has made honest communication between the two communities nearly
                impossible.

                Recognizing the variety of callings within the body of Christ (e.g. of Paul as an apostle to the Gentiles; James and Peter to "the
                circumcision") we believe it is unwise to appear to be promoting the Messianic movement as Bridges for Peace's mandate, while our
                calling is building bridges between the Jewish community and the wider body of Christ. This is not meant to restrict your personal
                choices of worship, it just means that Bridges for Peace, as an organization, is not to be identified with or promote Messianic Jewish
                activities.

                Our ministry seeks to repair centuries of Jewish pain, as members of the worldwide Church. Our calling is unique and specialized. We
                walk a fine line between the Jewish world and the Christian world.
            </div>
            <div className="mb-3">
                In light of this, it is necessary that all of the Bridges for Peace staff be in complete agreement with the vision, calling and style
                of Bridges for Peace. It is not possible or permissible for a person to be a staff member of Bridges for Peace, sharing our calling,
                vision and values during working hours and then be involved in activities during off hours that are not in full agreement with our
                calling, vision and values. A staff member must commit to follow the vision 24/7. While a staff member may attend a congregation which
                is not in full agreement, that staff member should not be in leadership, frontline involvement or participate in any outreach programs
                which could jeopardize the ministry of Bridges for Peace in Israel.

                When a Bridges for Peace center opens in a new region of Israel, any staff members attached to that center will not attend local
                congregations until such time as a positive reputation has been developed in the community, Bridges for Peace leadership has an
                opportunity to assess the reputation of the various congregations in the eyes of the Jewish majority and the senior leadership team
